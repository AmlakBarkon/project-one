# Project 1 Evaluation

## Planning / Process / Submission

>See recommended additions in 'readme.md'

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

to restart the game, a timer, etc.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues.
>Try to stay consistent with code formatting (indentations, spacing, etc.)

## Creativity and Interface
